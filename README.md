# LintMarkdown

A very simple package that sets my favored lintrs and runs on both .Rmd and .R.

Example:
```r
lint_dir_rmd()
```

Used with github actions on some classwork, 
[for instance](https://github.com/URMC-BST/hw02-accidents).

Todo:
Find a lintr for the prose portion of the markdown documents.
